# CBS-Case-Competition_Digi_Nomads

The CCC Global is a [CBS case competition](https://www.casecompetition.com/) organized by Copenhagen Business School, Denmark. The focus of the competition is to provide a collaboration of multicultural people by giving exposure to grow in a challenging environment. Every year, students around the world participate in this competition and work on a real-life company case for one day and provide a solution based on the analysis. This year 2021, IKEA has been chosen as the company case study by having an IKEA Upcycle Challenge for students. In the IKEA X CBS Sustainability case, the challenge was to identify "How IKEA makes sustainable choices easier for the many customers?". Our project analysis highlights key challenges and uncertainty and sustainable solutions to the challenges. A detailed overview of our solution can be studied in the Project report.
